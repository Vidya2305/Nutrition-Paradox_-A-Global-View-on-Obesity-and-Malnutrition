# Nutrition Paradox_ A Global View on Obesity and Malnutrition
**Project Title:** ⚖️ Nutrition Paradox: A Global View on Obesity and Malnutrition

**Domain:** Global Health & Nutrition Analytics

**Business Use Cases:**

● Nutrition Risk Monitoring: Identify countries with extremely high obesity or malnutrition levels, flagging them for public health intervention.

● Demographic Disparity Analysis: Understand how gender and age groups contribute differently to obesity and malnutrition statistics.

● Data-Driven Policy Planning: Help policymakers prioritize regions for funding and nutrition-related programs based on multi-dimensional data.

● Comparative Region Analysis: Enable researchers to compare regional trends and draw correlations between health indicators and socio-economic conditions.

● Public Health Reporting: Provide government or NGOs with a summarized SQL + Power BI dashboard showing country-level nutrition trends.

**📚Project Approach:**

**Step 1:** Dataset Overview & Collection

**Step 2:** 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering


**Step:3** 🧮 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python

Key EDA tasks may include:

● Understanding the shape and structure of the data

● Identifying missing values or unusual values

Tried different visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn or Plotly to uncover interesting patterns
